In the project directory, to install dependencies:
```
$ yarn install
```

In the project directory, you can run:
```
$ yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser

```
$ yarn test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

```
$ yarn build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder

```
$ yarn eject
```
